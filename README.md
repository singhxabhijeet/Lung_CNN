# Lung_CNN

This project focuses on the application of machine learning for the classification of histopathological images of lung cancer. Utilizing the LC25000 dataset, this project aims to automate the diagnosis process by differentiating between various types of cancerous and non-cancerous tissues. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the project seeks to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in medical imaging
